# Product Design Case Study

This repository contains the **product discovery and UX design artifacts** for an application concept developed as an independent design exercise.

The goal of this project was to practice and demonstrate a **structured product thinking process**, from problem definition to early solution validation, rather than focusing on visual polish alone.



## 📌 Scope of the Project

The work covers the following stages of the product design process:

- Problem Statement
- User Persona
- User Journey Map
- Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Prototype

All artifacts were created in **Figma** and are documented here for transparency and review.



## 🧠 Problem Statement

> _Describe the core problem the product is addressing._

- What problem exists?
- Who experiences it?
- Why is it worth solving?

**Example:**
Users struggle to stay engaged with local restaurants due to a lack of simple and meaningful digital touchpoints.



## 👤 User Persona

A primary persona was defined to represent the target user and guide design decisions.

**Persona includes:**
- Goals
- Motivations
- Frustrations
- Context of use

## 🗺️ User Journey Map

The user journey illustrates the end-to-end experience, highlighting:

- User actions
- Thoughts and emotions
- Pain points
- Opportunities for improvement

## ✏️ Wireframes (Low-Fidelity)

Low-fidelity wireframes were created to explore layout, hierarchy, and navigation before moving to visual design.

The focus at this stage was on:
- Information architecture
- User flow clarity
- Interaction simplicity

## 🔁 Prototype

An interactive prototype was built to validate the main user flow and navigation structure.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Figma** — design, wireframes, and prototyping
- **Markdown** — documentation



## 📂 Design Files

Source design files are intentionally **not stored in this repository**.

Figma already provides:
- Version control
- Collaboration
- Comments
- Design history

This repository focuses on **documentation and presentation**, while Figma remains the single source of truth for design work.



## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This project is intended to demonstrate:

- Product thinking
- UX reasoning
- Structured design process
- Clear documentation
